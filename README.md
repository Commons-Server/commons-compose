Not exaclty an inspiring name.

This repository aims to collect all the Docker configuration, and help required to create a Federated Wiki based Commons Server. This docker based install is for now targetted at Digital Ocean using docker-compose, Traefik and associated services.

# Template Repository
Anyone with read permissions to a template repository can create a repository from that template. For more information, see "Creating a template repository."

You can choose to include the directory structure and files from only the default branch of the template repository or to include all branches.

Creating a repository from a template is similar to forking a repository, but there are important differences:

1. A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
1. Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
1. A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.
